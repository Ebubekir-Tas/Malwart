**This is a very old and outdated project I used to practice web development, not professional standard.**

Website: https://malwart.netlify.app/

This is a responsive e-Commerce website made to demonstrate my knowledge and skills utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery. 

The webpage design and name of Malwart is a satirical interpretation of the famous brand Walmart.
